# Status Report for IS 477 Final Project

## **Updated Project Overview: Introduction**

During this update, we integrated individual-level health data with simulated state-level socioeconomic indicators to analyze factors that influence stroke occurrence. Our main focus of these past few weeks were to engineer synthetic features such as individual income and education score, and explore interaction effects in order to uncover insights into how socioeconomic disadvantage compounds biological risk.

## **Individual Data Analysis**
We initially looked into the correlation between the individual data sets through creating a pairplot and a heatmap of the stroke dataset. We noticed that there was a moderate relationship between age and stroke, age and hypertension, bmi and if an individual was married, and bmi and age.

## **Initial Data Integration**

Before we talk about the integration analysis, I thought it was appropriate to note that the way we integrated our two datasets was through a simulated mapping process. Since our state-level Census Dataset didn't include the geographic identifier of state type, we utilized the Rural Urban Continuum Codes in order to assign whether each state was generalized as urban, rural, or mixed. Since our individual-level dataset included a residence_type variable that assigned whether an individual lived in a rural or urban area, we were able to randomly assign a state to each person, ensuring that each person in the stroke dataset was labled with a state that matched their urban/rural context. 

After executing a correlation matrix on our integrated data analysis, there was very little correlation between the features of our ACI Census Data and our Stroke Dataset and it makes sense since we were integrating individual person data with average state data. Therefore, I thought it was appropriate to try to generate simulated data to calculate the approximate individual income and education level.

## **Data Integration & Simulation**

- **`individual_income`**: Generated by adding normally distributed noise (±$10K) to the state’s median income, allowing for within-state income variability.
- **`education_score`**: A weighted average of state-level education attainment, assigning points from 1 (HS Grad) to 4 (Doctorate), normalized to a 0–100 scale. Note that this approximates a person’s educational environment, not their literal degree.

## **Feature Engineering**

Additionally, besides simulating data, we also looked into interaction terms in order to capture the relationship between individual features that have multicollinearity. This included:

- `income_x_age`: Simulating the compounded risk of low income and aging
- `income_x_glucose`: Income’s influence on glucose control and diet
- `education_x_bmi`: Education's potential influence on weight/health behavior

These interaction features were designed to surface complex relationships that wouldn’t appear through standalone variables alone.
---

## **Correlation Analysis**

We explored several key correlations using the engineered dataset, comparing health indicators, income, and interaction features to stroke risk. While some insights emerged, especially through interaction terms, it’s important to contextualize these results with the limitations of the underlying data.

## **Individual Data Analysis VS Integrated Data Analysis**
> **Interpretation:** No significant linear relationship. This may reflect the limitations of simulated income and a lack of granularity in the state-level input data.

Socioeconomic Variables and Interaction Terms vs Stroke
| Feature                 | Correlation with Stroke |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Median_Income          | +0.012                   |
| Individual_Income      | +0.006                   |
| Education_Score        | −0.017                   |
| `income_x_age`         | **+0.206**               |
| `income_x_glucose`     | +0.119                   |
| `education_x_bmi`      | −0.006                   |

> **Interpretation:** Interaction terms revealed stronger relationships, especially where age magnifies the effect of income or glucose on stroke risk.

## Limitations of Correlation Results

Several factors limit the strength and reliability of correlation insights:

1. **Mismatch in Granularity**: We combined **individual-level health data** with **state-level average data**. State-level features are coarse and may not capture the local socioeconomic realities individuals actually experience.

2. **Simulated Socioeconomic Variables**: Features like `individual_income` and `education_score` were engineered based on assumptions and random noise. While useful for pattern discovery, they don't represent real, observed person-level SES data.

3. **No Geographic Continuity**: The simulated assignment of states breaks potential geographic clusters. In reality, neighboring regions or urban-rural divides may shape health outcomes through infrastructure and policy differences.

4. **Unmeasured Confounders**: Factors such as diet, physical activity, mental health, access to preventive care, and genetics are not captured in the dataset. These could explain much of the variation in stroke occurrence beyond what's modeled here.

5. **Class Imbalance in Stroke Data**: Stroke cases are rare in the dataset, which further reduces the power of correlations and skews classification models unless corrected with balancing techniques.

> Despite these limitations, the process of simulating variation and testing interaction terms has helped surface **non-obvious relationships** that can guide future modeling or real-world health policy questions.
